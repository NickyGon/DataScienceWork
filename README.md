## General info
This is a repository with files regarding the best of my work made for two classes (Data Science and AI Select Topics) during my studies at Universidad Privada Boliviana last year
	
## Technologies
This collection of projects is created via Python Notebooks using
* Google Colab
* Jupyter Notebook
	
## Setup
To run the projects, it is required to either
* Download and install the latest Python version, alongside Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook
* Have a Google account, go to Google Colab, and import the notebooks (this more recommended for those notebook that don't require external files from the computer to work, but they can be adjusted if wanting to import those files to the Colab workplace)
